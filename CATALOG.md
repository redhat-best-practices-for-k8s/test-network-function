# test-network-function test case catalog

test-network-function contains a variety of `Test Cases`, as well as `Test Case Building Blocks`.
* Test Cases:  Traditional JUnit testcases, which are specified internally using `Ginkgo.It`.  Test cases often utilize several Test Case Building Blocks.
* Test Case Building Blocks:  Self-contained building blocks, which perform a small task in the context of `oc`, `ssh`, `shell`, or some other `Expecter`.
## Test Case Catalog

Test Cases are the specifications used to perform a meaningful test.  Test cases may run once, or several times against several targets.  CNF Certification includes a number of normative and informative tests to ensure CNFs follow best practices.  Here is the list of available Test Cases:
### http://test-network-function.com/testcases/generic/services-do-not-use-nodeports

Property|Description
---|---
Version|v1.0.0
Description|http://test-network-function.com/testcases/generic/services-do-not-use-nodeports tests that each CNF Service does not utilize NodePort(s).
Result Type|normative
Suggested Remediation|Ensure Services are not configured to not use NodePort(s).
### http://test-network-function.com/testcases/generic/list-cni-plugins

Property|Description
---|---
Version|v1.0.0
Description|http://test-network-function.com/testcases/generic/list-cni-plugins lists CNI plugins
Result Type|normative
Suggested Remediation|
### http://test-network-function.com/testcases/generic/pod-lifecycle-pre-stop

Property|Description
---|---
Version|v1.0.0
Description|http://test-network-function.com/testcases/generic/pod-lifecycle-pre-stop Ensure that the containers lifecycle pre-stop management feature is configured.
Result Type|normative
Suggested Remediation| 		It's considered best-practices to define prestop for proper management of container lifecycle. 		The prestop can be used to gracefully stop the container and clean resources (e.g., DB connexion). 		 		The prestop can be configured using : 		 1) Exec : executes the supplied command inside the container 		 2) HTTP : executes HTTP request against the specified endpoint. 		 		When defined. K8s will handle shutdown of the container using the following: 		1) K8s first execute the preStop hook inside the container. 		2) K8s will wait for a grace perdiod. 		3) K8s will clean the remaining processes using KILL signal.		 			
### http://test-network-function.com/testcases/generic/non-tainted-node-kernel

Property|Description
---|---
Version|v1.0.0
Description|http://test-network-function.com/testcases/generic/non-tainted-node-kernel ensures that the Node(s) hosting CNFs do not utilize tainted kernels. This test case is especially important to support Highly Available CNFs, since when a CNF is re-instantiated on a backup Node, that Node's kernel may not have the same hacks.'
Result Type|normative
Suggested Remediation|Test failure indicates that the underlying Node's' kernel is tainted.  Ensure that you have not altered underlying Node(s) kernels in order to run the CNF.
### http://test-network-function.com/testcases/generic/pod-node-selector-node-affinity-best-practices

Property|Description
---|---
Version|v1.0.0
Description|http://test-network-function.com/testcases/generic/pod-node-selector-node-affinity-best-practices ensures that CNF Pods do not specify nodeSelector or nodeAffinity.  In most cases, Pods should allow for instantiation on any underlying Node.
Result Type|informative
Suggested Remediation|In most cases, Pod's should not specify their host Nodes through nodeSelector or nodeAffinity.  However, there are cases in which CNFs require specialized hardware specific to a particular class of Node.  As such, this test is purely informative, and will not prevent a CNF from being certified. However, one should have an appropriate justification as to why nodeSelector and/or nodeAffinity is utilized by a CNF.
### http://test-network-function.com/testcases/generic/hugepages-not-manually-manipulated

Property|Description
---|---
Version|v1.0.0
Description|http://test-network-function.com/testcases/generic/hugepages-not-manually-manipulated checks to see that HugePage settings have been configured through MachineConfig, and not manually on the underlying Node.  This test case applies only to Nodes that are configured with the "worker" MachineConfigSet.  First, the "worker" MachineConfig is polled, and the Hugepage settings are extracted.  Next, the underlying Nodes are polled for configured HugePages through inspection of /proc/meminfo.  The results are compared, and the test passes only if they are the same.
Result Type|normative
Suggested Remediation|HugePage settings should be configured either directly through the MachineConfigOperator or indirectly using the PeformanceAddonOperator.  This ensures that OpenShift is aware of the special MachineConfig requirements, and can provision your CNF on a Node that is part of the corresponding MachineConfigSet.  Avoid making changes directly to an underlying Node, and let OpenShift handle the heavy lifting of configuring advanced settings.
### http://test-network-function.com/testcases/generic/namespace-best-practices

Property|Description
---|---
Version|v1.0.0
Description|http://test-network-function.com/testcases/generic/namespace-best-practices tests that CNFs utilize a CNF-specific namespace, and that the namespace does not start with "openshift-". OpenShift may host a variety of CNF and software applications, and multi-tenancy of such applications is supported through namespaces.  As such, each CNF should be a good neighbor, and utilize an appropriate, unique namespace.
Result Type|normative
Suggested Remediation|Ensure that your CNF utilizes a CNF-specific namespace.  Additionally, the CNF-specific namespace should not start with "openshift-", except in rare cases.
### http://test-network-function.com/testcases/operator/operator-is-installed-via-olm

Property|Description
---|---
Version|v1.0.0
Description|http://test-network-function.com/testcases/operator/operator-is-installed-via-olm tests whether a CNF Operator is installed via OLM.

Suggested Remediation|In high availability cases, Pod podAntiAffinity rule should be specified for pod scheduling and pod replica value is set more than 1 .
### http://test-network-function.com/testcases/generic/unaltered-startup-boot-params

Property|Description
---|---
Version|v1.0.0
Description|http://test-network-function.com/testcases/generic/unaltered-startup-boot-params tests that boot parameters are set through the MachineConfigOperator, and not set manually on the Node.
Result Type|normative
Suggested Remediation|Ensure that boot parameters are set directly through the MachineConfigOperator, or indirectly through the PerfromanceAddonOperator.  Boot parameters should not be changed directly through the Node, as OpenShift should manage the changes for you.
### http://test-network-function.com/testcases/container/container-is-certified

Property|Description
---|---
Version|v1.0.0
Description|http://test-network-function.com/testcases/container/container-is-certified tests whether container images have passed the Red Hat Container Certification Program (CCP).

Property|Description
---|---
Version|v1.0.0
Description|http://test-network-function.com/testcases/generic/non-default-grace-period tests whether the terminationGracePeriod is CNF-specific, or if the default (30s) is utilized.  This test is informative, and will not affect CNF Certification.  In many cases, the default terminationGracePeriod is perfectly acceptable for a CNF.
Result Type|informative
Suggested Remediation|Choose a terminationGracePeriod that is appropriate for your given CNF.  If the default (30s) is appropriate, then feel free to ignore this informative message.  This test is meant to raise awareness around how Pods are terminated, and to suggest that a CNF is configured based on its requirements.  In addition to a terminationGracePeriod, consider utilizing a termination hook in the case that your application requires special shutdown instructions.
### http://test-network-function.com/testcases/operator/operator-best-practices

The Pod cannot access Host Node PID space. 5. The Pod is not granted NET_ADMIN SCC. 6. The Pod is not granted SYS_ADMIN SCC. 7. The Pod does not run as root. 8. The Pod does not allow privileged escalation. 
Result Type|normative
Suggested Remediation|Ensure that each Pod in the CNF abides by the suggested best practices listed in the test description.  In some rare cases, not all best practices can be followed.  For example, some CNFs may be required to run as root.  Such exceptions should be handled on a case-by-case basis, and should provide a proper justification as to why the best practice(s) cannot be followed.
### http://test-network-function.com/testcases/generic/icmpv4-connectivity

Property|Description
---|---
Version|v1.0.0
Description|http://test-network-function.com/testcases/generic/icmpv4-connectivity checks that each CNF Container is able to communicate via ICMPv4 on the Default OpenShift network.  This test case requires the Deployment of the [CNF Certification Test Partner](https://github.com/test-network-function/cnf-certification-test-partner/blob/main/test-partner/partner.yaml). The test ensures that all CNF containers respond to ICMPv4 requests from the Partner Pod, and vice-versa. 
Result Type|normative
Suggested Remediation|Ensure that the CNF is able to communicate via the Default OpenShift network.  In some rare cases, CNFs may require routing table changes in order to communicate over the Default network.  In other cases, if the Container base image does not provide the "ip" or "ping" binaries, this test may not be applicable.
