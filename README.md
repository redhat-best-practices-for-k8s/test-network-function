# Test Network Function ![build](https://github.com/test-network-function/test-network-function/actions/workflows/merge.yaml/badge.svg) [![Go Report Card](https://goreportcard.com/badge/github.com/test-network-function/test-network-function)](https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/test-network-function/test-network-function)

This repository contains a set of network function test cases and the framework to build more.  It also generates reports
(claim.json) on the result of a test run.

Please consult [CATALOG.md](./CATALOG.md) for a catalog of the included test cases and test case building blocks.

The tests and framework are intended to test the interaction of Cloud-Native Network Functions (CNFs) with OpenShift
Container Platform.

The suite is provided here in part so that CNF Developers can use the suite to test their CNFs readiness for
certification.  Please see "CNF Developers" below for more information.

## Container

### Running

A container that can be used to run the tests is available from [quay.io](https://quay.io/repository/testnetworkfunction/test-network-function)

To pull the latest container and run the tests you use the following command. There are several required arguments:

* `-t` gives the local directory that contains tnf config files set up for the test.
* `-o` gives the local directory that the test results will be available in once the container exits.
* Finally, list the specs to be run must be specified, space-separated.

Optional arguments are:

* `-i` gives a name to a custom TNF container image. Supports local images, as well as images from external registries.
* `-k` gives a path to one or more kubeconfig files to be used by the container to authenticate with the cluster. Paths must be separated by a colon.
* `-n` gives the network mode of the container. Defaults to `bridge`. See the [docker run --network parameter reference](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/#network-settings) for more information on how to configure network settings.

If `-k` is not specified, autodiscovery is performed.
The autodiscovery first looks for paths in the `$KUBECONFIG` environment variable on the host system, and if the variable is not set or is empty, the default configuration stored in `$HOME/.kube/config` is checked.

```shell-script
./run-tnf-container.sh -k ~/.kube/config -t ~/tnf/config -o ~/tnf/output diagnostic generic
```

*Note*: Tests must be specified after all other arguments!

*Note*: The `run-tnf-container.sh` script performs autodiscovery of selected TNF environment variables.  
Currently supported environment variables include:
- `TNF_MINIKUBE_ONLY`
- `TNF_ENABLE_CONFIG_AUTODISCOVER`

#### Running using `docker` instead of `podman`

By default, `run-container.sh` utilizes `podman`.  However, you can configure an alternate container virtualization
client using `TNF_CONTAINER_CLIENT`.  This is particularly useful for operating systems that do not readily support
`podman`, such as macOS.  In order to configure the test harness to use `docker`, issue the following prior to
`run-tnf-container.sh`:

```shell script
export TNF_CONTAINER_CLIENT="docker"
```

### Building

You can build an image locally by using the command below. Use the value of `TNF_VERSION` to set a branch, a tag, or a hash of a commit that will be installed into the image.

```shell-script
docker build -t test-network-function:v1.0.5 --build-arg TNF_VERSION=v1.0.5 .
```

To build an image that installs TNF from an unofficial source (e.g. a fork of the TNF repository), use the `TNF_SRC_URL` build argument to override the URL to a source repository.

```shell-script
docker build -t test-network-function:v1.0.5 \
  --build-arg TNF_VERSION=v1.0.5 \
  --build-arg TNF_SRC_URL=https://github.com/test-network-function/test-network-function .
```

To make `run-tnf-container.sh` use the newly built image, specify the custom TNF image using the `-i` parameter.

```shell-script
./run-tnf-container.sh -i test-network-function:v1.0.5 -t ~/tnf/config -o ~/tnf/output diagnostic generic
```

## Dependencies

At a minimum, the following dependencies must be installed *prior* to running `make install-tools`.

Dependency|Minimum Version
---|---
[GoLang](https://golang.org/dl/)|1.14
[golangci-lint](https://golangci-lint.run/usage/install/)|1.32.2
[jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/)|1.6
[OpenShift Client](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.4/welcome/index.html)|4.4

Other binary dependencies required to run tests can be installed using the following command:

```shell-script
make install-tools
```

Finally the source dependencies can be installed with

```shell-script
make update-deps
```

*Note*: You must also make sure that `$GOBIN` (default `$GOPATH/bin`) is on your `$PATH`.

*Note*:  Efforts to containerize this offering are considered a work in progress.

## Available Test Specs

There are two categories for CNF tests;  'General' and 'CNF-specific'.

The 'General' tests are designed to test any commodity CNF running on OpenShift, and include specifications such as
'Default' network connectivity.

'CNF-specific' tests are designed to test some unique aspects of the CNF under test are behaving correctly.  This could
include specifications such as issuing a `GET` request to a web server, or passing traffic through an IPSEC tunnel.

## Turn off openshift required tests when CNF run on kubernetes only environment
when test on CNFs that run on k8s only environment, execute shell command below before compile tool and run test shell script.

```shell-command
export TNF_MINIKUBE_ONLY=true
```

## Disable intrusive tests
If you would like to skip intrusive tests which may disrupt cluster operations, issue the following:

```shell script
export TNF_NON_INTRUSIVE_ONLY=true
```

Likewise, to enable intrusive tests, set the following:

```shell-command
export TNF_NON_INTRUSIVE_ONLY=false
```

## Execute test suites from openshift-kni/cnf-feature-deploy
The test suites from openshift-kni/cnf-feature-deploy can be run prior to the actual CNF certification test execution and the results are incorporated in the same claim file if the following environment variable is set:


```shell-command
export VERIFY_CNF_FEATURES=true
```

Currently, these suites are skipped:
* performance
* sriov
* ptp
* sctp
* xt_u32
* dpdk
* ovn

For more information on the test suites, refer to [the cnf-features-deploy repository](https://github.com/openshift-kni/cnf-features-deploy/tree/release-4.6)

### General

The general-purpose category covers most tests.  It consists of multiple suites that can be run in any combination as is
appropriate for the CNF(s) under test:

Suite|Test Spec Description|Minimum OpenShift Version
---|---|---
diagnostic|The diagnostic test suite is used to gather node information from an OpenShift cluster.  The diagnostic test suite should be run whenever generating a claim.json file.|4.4.3
generic|The generic test suite is used to test `Default` network connectivity between containers.  It also checks that the base container image is based on `RHEL`.|4.4.3
multus|The multus test suite is used to test SR-IOV network connectivity between containers.|4.4.3
operator|The operator test suite is designed to test basic Kubernetes Operator functionality.|4.4.3
container|The container test suite is designed to test container functionality and configuration|4.4.3

Further information about the current offering for each test spec is included below.

### diagnostic tests

The `diagnostic` test spec issues commands to poll environment information which can be appended to the claim file.
This information is necessary to ensure a properly spec'd environment is used, and allows the claim to be reproduced.
As of today, the `diagnostic` test suite just polls `Node` information for all `Node`s in the cluster.  Future
iterations may consider running `lshw` or similar types of diagnostic tests.

### generic tests

The `generic` test spec tests:
1) `Default` network connectivity between containers.
2) That CNF container images are RHEL based.
3) That CNF pod namespace is not 'default' and does not begin with 'openshift-'.
4) That CNF pod uses a ServiceAccount that does not have ClusterRoleBindings and does not have RoleBinding in other namespaces.
5) That deployments in CNF namespace create new replicas successfully when needed.
6) Print a warning if a pod spec specifies nodeSelector/nodeAffinity.
7) Print a warning if a pod's terminationGracePeriod is set to 30s(the default in Openshift)

To test `Default` network connectivity, a [test partner pod](https://github.com/test-network-function/cnf-certification-test-partner)
is installed on the network.  The test partner pod is used as a known point when testing network connectivity of test target pods,
pinging to and from each pod under test. The test asserts that the test partner pod receives the correct number of replies, and vice versa.

In the future, other networking protocols aside from ICMPv4 should be tested.

### multus tests

Similar to the `generic` test spec, the `multus` test spec is utilized for CNFs that utilize multiple network
interfaces.  As of today, the `multus` test suite just tests that
a [test partner pod](https://github.com/test-network-function/cnf-certification-test-partner) can successfully ping the secondary
interface of the CNF containers.  Since SR-IOV is often utilized, and the secondary interface of a CNF cannot be
accessed in user space, the test is unidirectional.

### operator tests

Currently, the `operator` test spec is limited to three test cases called `OPERATOR_STATUS`.  `OPERATOR_STATUS`
checks that the `CSV` corresponding to the CNF Operator is properly installed and operator `Subscription` is available.
It checks whether operator is using privileged permissions by inspecting `clusterPermissions` specified in `CSV`. 

In the future, tests surrounding `Operational Lifecycle Management` will be added.

### container tests

The `container` test spec has the following test cases:

Test Name|Description
---|---
`HOST_NETWORK_CHECK`|Ensures that the CNF pods do not utilize host networking.  Note:  This test can be disabled for infrastructure CNFs that should utilize host networking.
`HOST_PORT_CHECK`|Ensures that the CNF pods do not utilize host ports.
`HOST_PATH_CHECK`|Ensures that the CNF pods do not utilize the host filesystem.
`HOST_IPC_CHECK`|Ensures that the CNF pods do not utilize host IPC namespace to access or control host processes.
`HOST_PID_CHECK`|Ensures that the CNF pods do not utilize host PID namespace to access or control host processes.
`CAPABILITY_CHECK`|Ensures that the CNF SCC is not configured to allow `NET_ADMIN` or `SYS_ADMIN`.
`ROOT_CHECK`|Ensure that the CNF pods are not run as `root`.
`PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION`|Ensure that the CNF SCC is not configured to allow privileged escalation.

In the future, we are considering additional tests to ensure aspects such as un-alteration of the container image.

## Performing Tests

Currently, all available tests are part of the "CNF Certification Test Suite" test suite, which serves as the entrypoint
to run all test specs.  `CNF Certification 1.0` is not containerized, and involves pulling, building, then running the
tests.

By default, `test-network-function` emits results to `test-network-function/cnf-certification-tests_junit.xml`.

The included default configuration is for running `generic` and `multus` suites on the trivial example at
[cnf-certification-test-partner](https://github.com/test-network-function/cnf-certification-test-partner).  To configure for your
own environment, please see [config.md](docs/config.md).

### Pulling The Code

In order to pull the code, issue the following command:

```shell-script
mkdir ~/workspace
cd ~/workspace
git clone git@github.com:test-network-function/test-network-function.git
cd test-network-function
```

### Building the Tests

In order to build the test executable, first make sure you have satisfied the [dependencies](#dependencies).

```shell-script
make build-cnf-tests
```

*Gotcha:* The `make build*` commands run unit tests where appropriate. They do NOT test the CNF.

### Testing a CNF

Once the executable is built, a CNF can be tested by specifying which suites to run using the `run-cnf-suites.sh` helper
script.
Any combination of the suites listed above can be run, e.g.

```shell-script
./run-cnf-suites.sh diagnostic
./run-cnf-suites.sh diagnostic generic
./run-cnf-suites.sh diagnostic generic multus
./run-cnf-suites.sh diagnostic operator
./run-cnf-suites.sh diagnostic generic multus container operator
```

By default the claim file will be output into the same location as the test executable. The `-o` argument for
`run-cnf-suites.sh` can be used to provide a new location that the output files will be saved to. For more detailed
control over the outputs, see the output of `test-network-function.test --help`.

```shell-script
cd test-network-function && ./test-network-function.test --help
```

*Gotcha:* The generic test suite requires that the CNF has both `ping` and `ip` binaries installed.  Please add them
manually if the CNF under test does not include these.  Automated installation of missing dependencies is targeted
for a future version.

## Test Configuration

Detailed configuration of the individual specs is explained in [config.md](docs/config.md).

By leveraging resource labels. Automoatic configuration will happen by default, that being said, it can be disabled if the environment variable `TNF_DISABLE_CONFIG_AUTODISCOVER` is set

```shell
TNF_DISABLE_CONFIG_AUTODISCOVER=true
```

Pods can be labelled at creation by including the label in their definition, or at any time using the `oc label`
command. Annotations are almost identical:

```shell
oc label pod test -n tnf test-network-function.com/generic=target
oc annotate pod test -n tnf test-network-function.com/skip_connectivity_tests=true
```

**NOTE** Currently when this environment variable is set the `generic` and `cnfs` sections of the config file will be
ENTIRELY replaced with the autodiscovered configuration, to avoid potentially non-obvious errors.

Autodiscovery is currently only supported in the generic spec, where the following applies:
### Pod Roles

* The test partner pod is identified by the label `test-network-function.com/generic=orchestrator`. This must identify a
single pod with a single container. This is equivalent to having an entry listed under `partnerContainers` in the config file.
* Each pod under is identified by the label `test-network-function.com/generic=target`. There must be at least
one such pod. This is equivalent to having a pod listed under `containersUnderTest` in the config file.
* If intrusive test is NOT disabled (refer to [intrusive tests](#Disable intrusive tests), the pod under test may get
recreated with a different name and lose the "target" label. It's **important** to populate the matching labels from the
deployment in the targetPodLabels section of the config file.
* If an FS Diff Master Pod is present it should be identified with,  `test-network-function.com/generic=fs_diff_master`. This
is equivalent to listing the pod under `fsDiffMasterContainer` in the config file.
* If a pod is not suitable for network connectivity tests because it lacks binaries (e.g. `ping`), it should be
given the label `test-network-function.com/skip_connectivity_tests` to exclude it from those tests. The label value is
not important, only its presence. Equivalent to `excludeContainersFromConnectivityTests` in the config file.

The autodiscovery mechanism will attempt to identify the default network device and all the IP addresses of the pods it
needs, though that information can be explicitly set using annotations if needed. The following rules apply:

### Pod IPs

* The annotation `test-network-function.com/multusips` is the highest priority, and must contain a JSON-encoded list of
IP addresses to be tested for the pod. This must be explicitly set.
* If the above is not present, the `k8s.v1.cni.cncf.io/networks-status` annotation is checked and all IPs from it are
used. This annotation is automatically managed in OpenShift but may not be present in K8s.
* If neither of the above is present, then only known IPs associated with the pod are used (the pod `.status.ips` field).

### Network Interfaces

* The annotation `test-network-function.com/defaultnetworkinterface` is the highest priority, and must contain a
JSON-encoded string of the primary network interface for the pod. This must be explicitly set if needed. Examples can
be seen in [cnf-certification-test-partner](https://github.com/test-network-function/cnf-certification-test-partner/local-test-infra/local-pod-under-test/local-partner-pod.yaml)
* If the above is not present, the `k8s.v1.cni.cncf.io/networks-status` annotation is checked and the `"interface"` from
the first entry found with `"default"=true` is used. This annotation is automatically managed in OpenShift but may not
be present in K8s.

### Container Spec

* Pods to be tested by the `container` spec are identified with the `test-network-function.com/container=target`
label. Any value is permitted but `target` is used here for consistency with the `generic` spec.
* If specific tests are to be run on the pod then they can be listed as a JSON-encoded list of strings under the
`test-network-function.com/container_tests` annotation. If the annotation is not found then by default every
group of CNF tests defined in `testconfigure.yml` will be run.

For example:
```yaml
...
  labels:
    test-network-function.com/container: target
  annotations:
    test-network-function.com/container_tests: "[\"PRIVILEGED_POD\",\"PRIVILEGED_ROLE\"]" # optional
...
```

### Operator Spec

* CSVs to be tested by the `operator` spec are identified with the `test-network-function-com/operator=target`
label. Any value is permitted but `target` is used here for consistency with the other specs.
* Defining which tests are to be run on the operator is done using the `test-network-function.com/operator_tests`
annotation. This is equivalent to the `test-network-function.com/container_tests` and behaves the same.
* `test-network-function.com/subscription_name` is optional and should contain a JSON-encoded string that's the name of
the subscription for this CSV. If unset, the CSV name will be used.

## Test Output

### Claim File

The test suite generates a "claim" file, which describes the system(s) under test, the tests that were run, and the
outcome of all of the tests.  This claim file is the proof of the test run that is evaluated by Red Hat when
"certified" status is being considered.  For more information about the contents of the claim file please see the
[schema](https://github.com/test-network-function/test-network-function-claim/blob/main/schemas/claim.schema.json).  You can
read more about the purpose of the claim file and CNF Certification in the
[Guide](https://redhat-connect.gitbook.io/openshift-badges/badges/cloud-native-network-functions-cnf).

### Adding Test Results for the CNF Validation Test Suite to a Claim File 
e.g. Adding a cnf platform test results to your existing claim file.

You can use the claim cli tool to append other related test suite results to your existing claim.json file.
The output of the tool will be an updated claim file.
```
go run cmd/tools/cmd/main.go claim-add --claimfile=claim.json --reportdir=/home/$USER/reports
```
 Args:  
`
--claimfile is an existing claim.json file`
`
--repordir :path to test results that you want to include.
`

 The tests result files from the given report dir will be appended under the result section of the claim file using file name as the key/value pair.
 The tool will ignore the test result, if the key name is already present under result section of the claim file.
```
 "results": {
 "cnf-certification-tests_junit": {
 "testsuite": {
 "-errors": "0",
 "-failures": "2",
 "-name": "CNF Certification Test Suite",
 "-tests": "14",
```

### Command Line Output

When run the CNF test suite will output a report to the terminal that is primarily useful for Developers to evaluate and
address problems.  This output is similar to many testing tools.

Here's an example of a Test pass.  It shows the Test running a command to extract the contents of `/etc/redhat-release`
and using a regular expression to match allowed strings.  It also prints out the string that matched.:

```shell

## Grading Tool
### Overview
A tool for processing the claim file and producing a quality grade for the CNF.
The user supplies a policy conforming to [policy schema](schemas/gradetool-policy-schema.json).
A grade is considered `passed` if all its direct tests passed and its base grade passed.
In the output we use the field `propose` to indicate grade passed or failed.
See [policy example](pkg/gradetool/testdata/policy-good.json) for understanding the output of the grading tool.
### How to build and execute
```
make build
or
make build-gradetool
```
Executable name is `gradetool`.

## CNF Developers

Developers of CNFs, particularly those targeting 
[CNF Certification with Red Hat on OpenShift](https://redhat-connect.gitbook.io/openshift-badges/badges/cloud-native-network-functions-cnf),
can use this suite to test the interaction of their CNF with OpenShift.  If you are interested in CNF Certification
please contact [Red Hat](https://redhat-connect.gitbook.io/red-hat-partner-connect-general-guide/managing-your-account/getting-help/technology-partner-success-desk).

Refer to the rest of the documentation in this file to see how to install and run the tests as well as how to
interpret the results.

You will need an [OpenShift 4.4 installation](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.4/welcome/index.html)
running your CNF, and at least one other machine available to host the test suite.  The
[cnf-certification-test-partner](https://github.com/test-network-function/cnf-certification-test-partner) repository has a very
simple example of this you can model your setup on.

# Known Issues

## Issue #146:  Shell Output larger than 16KB requires specification of the TNF_DEFAULT_BUFFER_SIZE environment variable

When dealing with large output, you may occasionally overrun the default buffer size. The manifestation of this issue is
a `json.SyntaxError`, and may look similar to the following:

```shell script
    Expected
        <*json.SyntaxError | 0xc0002bc020>: {
            msg: "unexpected end of JSON input",
            Offset: 660,
        }
    to be nil
```

In such cases, you will need to set the TNF_DEFAULT_BUFFER_SIZE to a sufficient size (in bytes) to handle the expected
output.

For example:

```shell script
TNF_DEFAULT_BUFFER_SIZE=32768 ./run-cnf-suites.sh diagnostic generic
```

## Issue-161 Some containers under test do not contain `ping` or `ip` binary utilities

In some cases, containers do not provide ping or ip binary utilities. Since these binaries are required for the
connectivity tests, we must exclude such containers from the connectivity test suite.  In order to exclude these
containers, please issue add the following to `test-network-function/generic_test_configuration.yaml`:

```yaml
excludeContainersFromConnectivityTests:
  - namespace: <namespace>
    podName: <podName>
    containerName: <containerName>
```

Note:  Future work may involve installing missing binary dependencies.
